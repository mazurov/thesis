A study of \chib production is performed on 3\invfb data set, collected
at a centre-of-mass energies 7 and 8 TeV, using \chib radiative transition to
\Y1S, \Y2S and \Y3S. A differential
production cross-sections, relative to the production cross-sections of
$\Upsilon$ mesons are measured as functions of $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum
in rapidity range $2.5 < y^{\Upsilon} < 4$. The considered transverse momentum
ranges for decays to \Y1S, \Y2S and \Y3S are $6<p_T^{\Y1S}<40\gev$,
$18<p_T^{\Y2S}<40\gev$ and $27<p_T^{\Y3S}<40\gev$, respectively. The measurement of
\chib(3P) fraction, relative to the production  of \Y3S  is performed for the first time.
The obtained values are 42 $\pm$
12\stat${}^{+8.9}_{-11.6}\syst^{+2.9}_{-2.9}\systpol \%$ and 41 $\pm$
8\stat${}^{+1.3}_{-8.6}\syst^{+2.8}_{-2.9}\systpol \%$ for \sqs=7 and 8 \tev,
respectively. The measured \chiboneThreeP mass is $10{,}508 \pm 2\stat \pm
8\syst \mevcc$.

Described the profiling tool, which helps to analyze and improve a software
performance at \lhcb experiment.
