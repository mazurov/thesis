A study of \chib production is performed on 3\invfb data set, collected
at \sqs=7 and 8 TeV, using \chib radiative transition to
\Y1S, \Y2S and \Y3S. The fraction of $\Upsilon$ originating from \chib decays
are measured as functions of $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum in rapidity range
$2.0 < y^{\Upsilon} < 4.5$. The analyzed transverse momentum ranges for decays
to \Y1S, \Y2S and \Y3S are $6<p_T^{\Y1S}<40\gev$, $18<p_T^{\Y2S}<40\gev$ and
$27<p_T^{\Y3S}<40\gev$, respectively. The measurement of
\Y3S fractions in radiative \chibThreeP decay is performed for the first time.
The obtained \Y3S fractions are 42 $\pm$ 12\stat${}^{+8.9}_{-11.6}\syst^{+2.7}_{-3.1}\systpol \%$ and 41 $\pm$ 8\stat${}^{+1.3}_{-8.6}\syst^{+2.6}_{-3.1}\systpol \%$ for \sqs=7 and 8 \tev,
respectively. The measured \chiboneThreeP mass is $10{,}508 \pm 2\stat \pm
8\syst \mevcc$.

Described the profiling tool, which helps to analyze and improve a software
performance at the \lhcb experiment.
