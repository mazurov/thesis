A study of $\chi_b$ production is performed on 3fb$^{-1}$ data set, collected
at a centre-of-mass energies 7 and 8 TeV, using \chib radiative transition to
\Y1S, \Y2S and \Y3S. A single differential
production cross-sections, relative to the production cross-sections of
$\Upsilon$ mesons are measured as functions of $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum
in rapidity range $2.5 < y^{\Upsilon} < 4$. The cross-section is
measured
