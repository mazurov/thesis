A study of $\chi_b$ production is performed on 3fb$^{-1}$ data set, collected
at a centre-of-mass energies 7 and 8 TeV, using
$\chi_b(nP)\rightarrow\Upsilon(mS)\gamma$ decays. A single differential
production cross sections, relative to the production cross-sections of
$\Upsilon$ mesons are measured as functions of $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum.
