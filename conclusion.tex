\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis were completed the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}

\item  A single differential \chib production cross sections,
relative to the production  cross-sections of $\Upsilon$ mesons were measured
as functions of $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum in the rapidity range $2.0 <
y^{\Upsilon} < 4.5$. The study  was performed on 3\invfb data set, collected at
a centre-of-mass energies \sqs=7 and 8\tev at the \lhcb experiment, using \chib
radiative decays to \Y1S, \Y2S and \Y3S. The results in this study extend
previous LHCb measurements to considerably more decays, higher transverse
momentum regions.  The measurement of \Y3S fraction in radiative \chibThreeP
decay was performed for the first time.

\item A measurement of the $\chi_{b1}(3P)$ mass was  performed. The result is
in good agreement with the recent \lhcb unpublished study with converted photons.

\item The profiling tool was developed. This profiler helps to analyze and improve a
software performance at \lhcb experiment.
