\subsection{Data - simulation comparison}
\label{sec:mc:datavsmc}

A comparison of the distribution of the relevant observables used in this
analysis was performed on real and simulated data, in order to assess the
reliability of Monte Carlo in computing efficiencies. It should be stressed
that, since a relative branching fraction is measured, systematic effects cancel
at first order.

Combinatorial background has been subtracted in real data by using an
\sPlot  technique~\cite{Pivk:2004ty}.
The resulting signal weights are used to obtain the signal distribution for each
relevant variable. 

% These distributions are compared with simulation, as
% shown in Figures~[\ref{fig:mc:datavsmc:compare1}, \ref{fig:mc:datavsmc:compare2}].

In Figures~\ref{fig:mc:datavsmc:compare1} and \ref{fig:mc:datavsmc:compare2}
these distributions  are shown for signals in $\chib \to \Y1S \gamma$ decays
compared with the corresponding simulated distributions.

The agreement is generally very good except the distribution of photon
transverse momentum ~\ref{fig:mc:datavsmc:gamma}. Imperfect  distribution of
photon transverse momentum can be explained by incorrect sPlot behavior in case
when this technique is applied on variables that affect the background form. In
our study background form depends on the photon transverse momentum.

\subsection{Selection efficiencies}
\label{sec:mc:eff}

The invariant mass difference distributions of matched events in the \chib
simulation are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mc:eff:nominal}. The left tails are
almost flat at these plots, so on the real data the signal events in these parts
are hard to separate from background. For this reason the number of MC-true
\chib events for efficiency measurements were obtained by performing a fit with
the background component that matches events the tails. The number of $\Upsilon$
events is obtained by counting MC-true $\Upsilon$ events.

Figure~\ref{fig:mc:eff} show the measured efficiency of \chib reconstruction.
More details on these measurements are show in
Tables~[\ref{tab:mc:eff:chib1_y1}--\ref{tab:mc:eff:chib3_y3}] in Appendix.
