\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In summary, the fractions of $\Upsilon(1,2,3S)$ states originating from $\chi_b(1,2,3P)$ 
radiative decays has been measured on the full data sample collected by LHCb in 2011 and 2012 
at center of mass energies of 7 and 8 \tev respectively, as a function of the $\Upsilon$ 
transverse momentum. Results are shown in~\Cref{fig:results}
and~\Crefrange{tab:frac:ups1s_final}{tab:frac:ups3s_final}.
\Cref{fig:results_2010} shows the previous analysis results which
are consistent with the current results.

The results in this study extend previous LHCb measurements to considerably
more decays, higher transverse momentum regions and increased statistical
precision.

In this study the \chiboneThreeP was measured to be $10{,}508 \pm 2\stat \pm 8\syst \mevc$ that
is in good agreement with the recent \lhcb measurements with converted photons.
