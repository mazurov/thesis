\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In summary, the fractions of $\Upsilon(1,2,3S)$ mesons originating from $\chi_b(1,2,3P)$ 
radiative decays has been measured on the full data sample collected by LHCb in 2011 and 2012 
at center of mass energies of 7 and 8 \tev respectively, as a function of the $\Upsilon$ 
transverse momentum. Results are shown in~\Cref{fig:results}
and~\Crefrange{tab:frac:ups1s_final}{tab:frac:ups3s_final}.
\Cref{fig:results_2010} shows previous \lhcb results which
are consistent with the current ones.

The results in this study extend previous \lhcb measurements to considerably
more decays, higher transverse momentum regions and increased statistical
precision. The measurement of the 
\Y3S production fraction due to radiative \chibThreeP decays is performed for the first time.

Also, in this study the \chiboneThreeP mass was measured to be $10{,}508 \pm 2\stat \pm 8\syst \mevcc$, 
which is in good agreement with a recent unpublished \lhcb measurement with converted photons.
